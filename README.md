Sophomore high school student exploring coding and sports analytics. I enjoy building small Python projects that combine my love for sports with problem-solving and data analysis. My goal is to grow my skills, create meaningful projects, and share them in this portfolio.


This Python program tracks a sports team’s wins and losses and calculates win percentages
